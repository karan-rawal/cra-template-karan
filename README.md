# CRA Template by Karan Rawal

This template serves as a base for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and includes default support for:

1. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
2. [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
3. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

To use this template, add the `--template cra-template-karan` option when running the create-react-app command.

**Recommendations:**
1. For optimal use of this template, it's recommended to use VSCode as your IDE, with the [eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extensions installed.
2. If the current version of the [eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension for VSCode is incompatible with the latest version of eslint, consider switching to the pre-release version of the eslint extension. This should resolve any compatibility issues.
