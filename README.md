# CRA template created by Karan Rawal

This is a base template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Template supports the following by default:
1. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
2. [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
3. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)


You can use this template by specifying `--template karan-cra-template` option to the create-react-app command.

Note:
1. To make the most of this template it is recommended to use VSCode as the IDE with [eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extensions.
2. Current version of [eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension for vscode doesn't work on [eslint 9](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). Switch the eslint extension to pre-release and it should start working.
